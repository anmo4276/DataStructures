Data Structures (CSCI 2270)
-------------------------
COURSE TOPICS
--------------
Studies data abstractions (e.g., stacks, queues, lists, trees) and their representation techniques (e.g.,
linking, arrays). Introduces concepts used in algorithm design and analysis including criteria for selecting
data structures to fit their applications.

COURSE OUTCOMES
----------------
In this course, students will:

1. Document code including precondition/postcondition contracts for functions and invariants for
classes.

2. Create and recognize appropriate test data for simple problems, including testing boundary
conditions and creating/running test cases.

3. Design and test new classes using the principle of information hiding for the following data structures:
array-based collections (including dynamic arrays), list-based collections (singly-linked lists,
doubly-linked lists, circular-linked lists), stacks, queues, binary search trees, hash tables, graphs, and at
least one balanced search tree.

4. Identify features and applications of common data structures, including records/structs, lists, stacks,
queues, trees, graphs, and maps.

5. Implement algorithms for standard operations on common data structures and discuss the complexity
of the operations.

6. Comment on the features of different traversal methods for trees and graphs, including pre-, post-,
and in-order traversal of trees.

7. Describe the implementation of hash tables, including algorithms for collision avoidance and
resolution.

8. Describe the principles of recursion and iteration and implement recursive and iterative solutions for
a problem.

9. Formulate and implement solutions to problems using fundamental graph algorithms, including
depth-first search, breadth-first search, and a Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

10. Explain the features of at least one tree balancing algorithm and how tree balancing affects the
efficiency of various binary search tree operations.

11. Correctly use and manipulate pointer variables to change variables and build dynamic data
structures.

12. Explain the differences between dynamic and static data structure implementations, and justify the
use of static and dynamic implementations in different applications.

13. Practice explaining design choices and algorithm features in small-group settings.
